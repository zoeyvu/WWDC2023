about boids algorithm

sorry I was too lazy to make screenshots and description for this beautiful piece of code/animation. Please just open it and enjoy the beautiful hues of sunset and calculated birds flocking behaviors.

it was featured somewhere in Apple Education page I think.

Steps to play with the app

1. Have a Macbook. Go to AppStore, download "Playground" (with a bird icon)
2. Download and unzip the file "Boids copy.swiftpm.zip"
3. After unziping, you will have the file "Boids copy.swiftpm"
4. Open the file with Playground app you downloaded earlier
5. Click the "Run" button on top
6. Wait about 1 minute for the app to render. This is long I know :(
7. Have fun!
